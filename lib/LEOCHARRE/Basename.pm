Returns abs path.
Returns undef on fail.

=head2 abs_file()

Arg is path string.
Checks that it is a file on disk.
Returns abs path.
Returns undef on fail.


=head2 abs_dir_or_die()

Arg is path string.
Checks that it is a dir on disk.
Returns abs path.
Dies on fail.

=head2 abs_file_or_die()

Arg is path string.
Checks that it is a file on disk.
Returns abs path.
Dies on fail.

=head2 abs_loc()

Arg is path string.
Checks that it exists on disk.
Returns abs path to parent directory.
Returns undef on fail.

=head2 abs_path()

Arg is path string.
Checks that it exists on disk.
Returns abs path.
Returns undef on fail.

=head2 dirname()

Arg is path string, or string.

=head2 filename() basename()

Arg is path string, or string.

=head2 filename_ext()

Arg is path string, or string.
Cleans up and returns filename extesion.

Optional argument is a list or strings to match, an array ref of strings to match, 
or a quoted regex.
Note that the matching is done to the extension, not to the file or path name.

   # returns 'fey':
   filename_ext('tina.fey');

   # returns undef:
   filename_ext('tina');

   # returns undef:
   filename_ext('tina.');

   # returns 'fey':
   filename_ext('tina.fey',qw/fey txt jpg/);

   # returns undef:
   filename_ext('tina.fey',qw/txt jpg/);

   # returns 'fey':
   filename_ext('tina.fey',qr/txt|TXT|fey/);

   # returns undef:
   filename_ext('tina.fey',[qw/txt jpg FEY/]);

   # returns 'fey':
   filename_ext('tina.fey',[qw/txt jpg FEY/]);

   grep { filename_ext( $_,qr/txt/i ) } @filepaths



=head2 filename_only()

Arg is path string, or string.
Cleans up and returns filename without extension.
If it has no extension, returns same arg.
